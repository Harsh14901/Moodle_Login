# Moodle_Login
Auto Login on Moodle for IITD students via the teminal

Login to moodle using Chrome just by typing moodle in the terminal. No need to solve the captcha every time.

To run the script just write 
``` python3 {path to script} ```

Note that for safety purposes it is advised not to store the passsword anywhere. The password will be input at the terminal itself. However the Kerberos ID can be saved and just edit the python script and change the `u_name` variable to your kerberos id.
